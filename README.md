# **Books Catalogue with JSON**
### **IFSL1T18 - Programming in JavaScript 3: JSON**

## **Description**
This is a books catalogue program that displays and stores information about a user's favourite books. It allows the user to add, edit and delete information, using event listeners, session storage and JSON to store and manage inputted data.

## **Installation and Setup**
1. Clone the repo and open with your preferred IDE (e.g. [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview)).
2. In the IDE, open the catalogue.html file and click the 'run' button, or click 'Go Live' if using VSCode. This should open your browser automatically to your localhost port with '/catalogue.html' as the URL endpoint.

## **How to Use**
1. Once the html file is loaded in your browser, fill out the form and click 'add your book'. This will add your book to your Favourites list.
2. Once you have added a book, you can edit it by selecting it from the dropdown and following the instructions in the prompts.
